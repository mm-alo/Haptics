**Hands-On Reality: Innovating Haptic Gloves for Enhanced Interaction in WebXR Applications**  

This project focuses on developing a web-based platform that enables real-time interaction between haptic gloves and WebXR applications. By leveraging web technologies, the system facilitates seamless data transmission between the user's physical hand movements and the virtual environment, enhancing immersion through tactile feedback. The platform is designed with online and offline communication protocols to ensure continuous functionality, even in limited connectivity scenarios. A calibration system is implemented to improve hand orientation accuracy, allowing for precise interactions in WebXR spaces. This web-based approach makes the system accessible across different devices without requiring extensive hardware modifications, broadening its applicability in virtual training, gaming, and remote collaboration.
